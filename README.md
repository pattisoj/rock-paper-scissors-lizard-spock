# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!

This repository contains the code for a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.
It was created on the Friday of my first week at the SchoolOfCode bootcamp.

The code inside of this project is very basic html and javascript. There is no styling as of writing.
Game function is completed by various prompts, confirmations and alerts and is not interactive with the DOM.

I plan to use this project as a point of reference of development as I present projects along the way and this is therefore
not an accurate representation of my current skill set.

## Usage.

Pull requests are welcome. As I am still learning on my journey large changes would not be appreciated, but smaller
alterations are welcome and may help me develop my understanding of well formatted code.
